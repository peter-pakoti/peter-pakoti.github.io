  <h2 id="question-classes">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>

  <p class="answer">Firstly, how not good my mindfulness really was. In the past I've been so quick to react and judge, not in a bad and open way but I recognise how the thoughts were still there. However now, I'm a lot more mindful and just take time to myself and take a step back and think first.</p>
  <p class="answer">Secondly, realising I had a fixed mindset in certain situations. For example, pretty much convinsing myself I can't do something before even trying and putting myself in a really stressful mindset. I have now started approaching exercises with a different mindset, a positive mindset! It really does make a big difference to how you learn and what you can learn.</p>
  <p class="answer">Lastly, none of these have been a stop, reset kind of improvement, it does take time to put these learning into practice, not only that but you need to recognise what could be improved and having the humility to be honest with yourself in order to make those changes.</p>

  <h2 id="question-classes">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>

  <p class="answer">Having empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming I think are two main values that everyone should work towards having. Empathy for everyone around you, the team you're working in, peers you're working with or whatever kind of environment you're working in, having empathy for those around you allows you to understand why someone may not be performing their best, or whatever it may be, it allows YOU to understand how that persons feeling and recognise how YOU can respond appropriately to the situation. Self-awareness is massively important, because it allows you to recognise the ability to focus on yourself and how your actions, thoughts and emotions affect your workflow. It allows you to think to yourself and ask why? Why am I feeling this way? Having self-awareness allows us to see ourselves clearly where we feel more confident in our ability to learn and improve.</p>

  <h2 id="question-classes">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>

  <p class="answer">Honestly how much my mindfulness has improved with programming and life in general. Whenever I came across something in the past that got a reaction out of me, my initial thought was to react. Whereas now I think to myself, "think about what you want to say and how you will say it" or whatever it may be I'm not as quick to react or JUDGE. I realise I'm not helping any situation with those initial instincts in mind.</p>

  <h2 id="question-classes">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>

  <p class="answer">For me the biggest challenge of the core learning aspects was taking time out to put them into practice. For example I've started doing the UCLA mindful meditation this week and want to make that a daily habbit throughout this course, I've done it in the past but that's only a handful of times and just being able to do it daily will be a massive bonus for my mental health. Also another thing I've found is how I start a new exercise and in the past it's been "what the fudge am I looking at?" and already having that fixed mindset of telling myself I can't do it, I don't understand BUT lately it's been "okay I don't understand that, let's do some research to find out what it means" and already has had huge results in terms of the way I attack these exercises.</p>

  <h2 id="question-classes">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>

  <p class="answer">I feel like it's because of the stress that may come from within the curiculum of bootcamp and being able to maintain a healthy mental health during this period will allow us students to work more effiently. It allows us to recognise our strengths, our weaknesses and how we best learn which creates for a more in depth understanding of who we are and how we work best. As you come across the problem solving aspect of the programming world, you will come across some pretty intense challenges where I think core learning is most important and not only that but you may face some pretty difficult people to deal with which is another reason to have strong core learnings. </p>

  <h2 id="question-classes">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>

  <p class="answer">Not at all, I feel like it has had a positive impact on my journey so far with a lot more space to improve. Coming into this program and hearing from past students how much this program focuses on the human side of the tech world, made me want to attend this course even more. I strongly agree and recognise the fact that this is an important aspect in this industry especially having solving problems all day can have a heavy weight to carry. </p>
