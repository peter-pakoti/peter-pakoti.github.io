  <h2 id="question-classes"> What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. IDs?</h2>

  <p class="answer">Well lets firstly start with explaining what classes and IDs are!
  </p>
  
  <p class="answer"> Both IDs and classes are used in a way to target a specific HTML element in our pages in order to give them a specific styling.
    </p>

  <p class="answer">
    When you're working with CSS, there are no specific reasons forcing you to use an ID over a class. However, it is best practice to only use IDs if you want a style to apply to one element on the web page, and to use classes if you want a style to apply to multiple elements.
  </p>

  <p class="answer">
To simplify this, it really is up to you! However if you want to improve your efficiency and keeping your code organised and tidy then I suggest you use these to help do so.
  </p>

  <p class="answer"> Now lets take a look at some examples to give you a better understanding of what I'm talking about!</p>

<div class="classes-img">
  <div class="ptag-b">
    <img src="..//Images/Screenshot (6).png" style="width:100%">
  </div>
  <div class="ptag-b">
    <img src="..//Images/Screenshot (7).png" style="width:100%">
  </div>
  <div class="ptag-b">
    <img src="../Images/Screenshot (9).png" style="width:100%">
  </div>
</div>
  
  <h4 id="image-a">Image-A</h4>
  <h4 id="image-b">Image-B</h4>
  <h4 id="image-c">Image-C</h4>

  <p class="answer"> In 'Image-A' you can see that we have some text in our p-tag. If we were to add changes to the p-tags style using our css file it would make changes to all those within the p-tag. But lets say I want to add changes to the top and bottom p-tag without affecting any of the other p-tags.This is where classes and IDs come in. </p>

  <p class="answer">
  Lets take a look at 'Image B'. We have now added a class to the top and bottom tags so now when we make want to make changes to those two p-tags using our css file it will change both those tags.
  </p>

  <p class="answer">
    Lets now take a look at IDs. In 'Image C' you can see that we have our p-tags within a group-tag that has a class called text. Now all changes made in that text class will affect all of these but lets say you want the middle p-tag to have a different color and as you can see in 'Image C' I've added a ID called color. This will overwrite the class and change that specific ID.
  </p>

<p class="answer"> 
  At the end of the day it really is up to you but remember it is best practice to only use IDs if you want a style to apply to one element on the web page, and to use classes if you want a style to apply to multiple elements.
