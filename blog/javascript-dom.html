  <h2 id="question">An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h2>

  <p class="js"> JavaScript is the funtionality of the website. This allows users to interact with the page. Now let's take a look at the image below!</p>

  <div class="ptag-c">
    <img src="../Images/website structure.jpg" style="width:100%">
  </div>
 
  <p class="js-exp"> As you can see in the image on my left, this is a pretty good respresentation of what each language is used for.You can see that HTML is basicly the skeleton or describing the structure of websites. Css is used for styling and allows you to beautify your website however you want. Which now brings us to JavaScript. JavaScript like I said earlier is the functionality of the website. An example of this is the ability to 'Add to cart' on shopping websites or another example of this could be videos or interactive images.

  <div class="ptag-d">
    <img src="../Images/lamp.png" style="width:100%">
  </div>

  <h2 id="question-js">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life.</h2>

  <p class="js-cf"> Let's start off by explaining what each one is used for. JavaScript by default runs our code from top to bottom, line by line, however we can change this with control flow. Control flow allows our program to make decisions about what code is executed and when.</p>

  <p class="js-cf"> Now lets touch on loops! Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return true or false . A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false .</p>

  <p class="js-cf"> If we take a look at the flow chart on our right it shows us how control flow and loops are used. Let me explain.</p>

  <p class="js-cf">Let's say if we had a lamp that isn't working. The first step is to check if the lamp is plugged in. If the lamp is plugged in then it will go to the next instruction, however, if it is not plugged in then we'll plug it in before moving on to the next step in this case your code will repeat until it the first instruction is completed. Now our next instruction is to check if the light bulbs burned out, if it isn't then we know we need to repair the lamp and if it is then we know we need to change the bulb. In conclusion this is a very basic way of explaing work flow and looping and what they do.</p>

  <h2 id="question-dom">Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h2>

  <p class="js"> The DOM is an acronym for 'Document Object Model' which we can use to interact with web pages, meaning, we can add, delete or even change content on an HTML document. An example of how we might interact with it are things like, changing the text within your H1 tag or we could change the background color of an element or we could even change the logo node going from left to right. These are only a few examples of what we can do.</p>

  <h2 id="question-dom">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h2>

  <div class="ptag-e">
    <img src="../Images/fuit bowl.jpg" style="width:100%">
  </div>
  <div class="ptag-e">
    <img src="../Images/lunch plate.jpg" style="width:100%">
  </div>

  <h4 id="fruit">Arrays</h4>
  <h4 id="lunch">Objects</h4>

  <p class="js-arrays">Let's take a look at the images above. On the left we can see a fruit bowl and on the right a lunch plate. Now our fruit bowl is going to be our 'Array' and our lunch plate will be our 'Objects'. An Array is usually used to store a collection of the same type of thing like our fruit bowl. Objects on the other hand can store a collection of different types of things like our lunch plate. </p>

  <p class="js-arrays">Now that we have an idea of what Arrays and Objects are, let's have a look at the differences when accessing data within them.</p>

  <p class="js-arrays">To access data in an Array you will firstly have the name of the Array followed by '[]' these square brackets. For example: 'Array name[index]'. Now to access data from objects is a little different and there are a few ways you can do this but for now we'll keep it simple. A common way to access the property of an object is the dot property accessor syntax which I will show an example of in the text below!</p>

  <p class="js-objects"> expression.indentifier</p>

  <p class="js-arrays">expression should evaluate to an object, and identifier is the name of the property you'd like to access.</p>

  <p class="js-objects">const hero = {
    name: 'Batman'
  };
  </p>

  <h2 id="question-dom">Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h2>

  <p class="js-arrays">A function is simply a “chunk” of code that you can use over and over again, rather than writing it out multiple times. Functions enable programmers to break down or decompose a problem into smaller chunks, each of which performs a particular task. This is helpful in the way that if we were to hard code our code we'd firstly have to find where each one is, change each one individualy, which just takes way to long. Now with functions you can do whatever whenever.</p>
