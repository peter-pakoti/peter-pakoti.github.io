<h2 id="question">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>

    <p class="values"> My goal is to become the best web developer I can and I know that won't come just over night but I know I can become really good at this. </p>

<h2 id="question">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>

    <p class="values"> I feel like I have a good foundation of strengths when it comes to learning like being persistant, not letting my ability frustrate me as I'm still new to this and dealing with stress and not letting that get in the way. In terms of limitations I think for me is just getting use to learning and studying again after all this time working, it really is something I'm still getting use to.</p>

<h2 id="question">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>

    <p class="values">Something I touched on in my values and identity is my lack of confidence and that's something I want to develop and improve on during my time here at DEV. </p>

<h2 id="question">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </h2>

    <p class="values">For me this is all about my schedule and sticking to that schedule. I have a schedule I've written out and sticking to that schedule in order to complete the goals that I set out for that day is what makes it so effective. For example from 9:30am to 11:30am that time is completely dedicated to study, no distractions or reduced distractions in order to stay focussed on my work before having lunch and taking a break away from the screen. The ability to step away from the screen to take a break is important to me because it allows me to come back to work with a fresh and clear mind which also helps my ability of dealing with stress. At times during lunch I will sometimes even go to the gym so that it completely takes my mind off whatever pithole I'm stuck in and helps me with clearing my mind. </p>

<h2 id="question">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>

    <p class="values">At the moment all it's been is checking in discord to see if anyone else has had the same problem, if not then I'll do my own research and if still nothing then I will post in discord which I know isn't the most timely way of seeking help but for me at the moment being able to reasearch and solve my own problems also allows me to take a mental note and learn from it.</p>

<h2 id="question">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>

    <p class="values">Honestly all I expect from the Facilitation team is guidence and a helping hand whenever needed. I know this course will get overwhelming and a bit much at times but having someone there to say "yup keep doing that, you're on the right track" is a huge help especially in those testing times.</p>

<h2 id="question">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h2>

    <p class="values"> This is something that I've already planned out in my own personal schedule, so from about 4pm to 8 or 9pm (dependent on what time the kids are asleep) is completely dedicated to my family. At 4pm my partner leaves for working so I need to be there for my kids and I don't want to just be there, I want to be present and for me not being able to work allows me to do so. Don't get me wrong if I'm behind and do need to get some work done it's usually after the kids are in bed.</p>
