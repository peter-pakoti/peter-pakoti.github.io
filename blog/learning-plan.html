    <h2 id="question-title">Foundations learning plan</h2>
          
      <h2 id="question">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>

        <p class="values"> My goal is to become the best web developer I can and I know that won't come just over night but I know I can become really good at this. </p>

      <h2 id="question">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>

        <p class="values"> I feel like I have a good foundation of strengths when it comes to learning like being persistant, not letting my ability frustrate me as I'm still new to this and dealing with stress and not letting that get in the way. In terms of limitations I think for me is just getting use to learning and studying again after all this time working, it really is something I'm still getting use to.</p>

      <h2 id="question">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>

        <p class="values">Something I touched on in my values and identity is my lack of confidence and that's something I want to develop and improve on during my time here at DEV. </p>

      <h2 id="question">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </h2>

        <p class="values">For me this is all about my schedule and sticking to that schedule. I have a schedule I've written out and sticking to that schedule in order to complete the goals that I set out for that day is what makes it so effective. For example from 9:30am to 11:30am that time is completely dedicated to study, no distractions or reduced distractions in order to stay focussed on my work before having lunch and taking a break away from the screen. The ability to step away from the screen to take a break is important to me because it allows me to come back to work with a fresh and clear mind which also helps my ability of dealing with stress. At times during lunch I will sometimes even go to the gym so that it completely takes my mind off whatever pithole I'm stuck in and helps me with clearing my mind. </p>

      <h2 id="question">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>

        <p class="values">At the moment all it's been is checking in discord to see if anyone else has had the same problem, if not then I'll do my own research and if still nothing then I will post in discord which I know isn't the most timely way of seeking help but for me at the moment being able to reasearch and solve my own problems also allows me to take a mental note and learn from it.</p>

      <h2 id="question">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>

        <p class="values">Honestly all I expect from the Facilitation team is guidence and a helping hand whenever needed. I know this course will get overwhelming and a bit much at times but having someone there to say "yup keep doing that, you're on the right track" is a huge help especially in those testing times.</p>

      <h2 id="question">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h2>

        <p class="values"> This is something that I've already planned out in my own personal schedule, so from about 4pm to 8 or 9pm (dependent on what time the kids are asleep) is completely dedicated to my family. At 4pm my partner leaves for working so I need to be there for my kids and I don't want to just be there, I want to be present and for me not being able to work allows me to do so. Don't get me wrong if I'm behind and do need to get some work done it's usually after the kids are in bed.</p>

      <h2 id="question-title">Bootcamp learning plan</h2>

        <h2 id="question">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>

          <p class="values">My long term goal is to take everything I will develop throughout this course both technical and human skills and use them to become the best programmer I can. I want to be a well developed programmer with good intentions and have the ability to help others around me with whatever they may be going through, wether that be programming or personally, I want to be someone in this tech world that lifts and helps grow those around me. I realise this will take time but this in my ultimate goal in terms of my career.</p>

        <h2 id="question">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>

          <p class="values">My strengths that I'll be bringing to bootcamp is my ability to keep and open mind to learning new things, new ways of doing things and do my best to include everyone around me. I also want to be able to help out where I can, and or be approachable for people in the case that they made need help.</p>

          <p class="values">I feel like my limitations that will improve during bootcamp is my ability to reach out to for help when I'm feeling lost and or confused. I do tend to reach out however this is after hours of being stuck. I know this will improve as I'm starting to feel more comfortable in this environment.</p>

        <h2 id="question">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>

          <p class="values">I feel like the biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp for me will be what I touched on in the previous question. I need to figure out why I struggle with reaching out for help and explore that abit so I can make improvements around it in the future which will only be helping me to grow as a developer.</p>

        <h2 id="question">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>

          <p class="values">Throughout the week of sprint 5 my goal was to start doing more meditation which has had a massive impact on my mental health throughout this week. It gave me the ability to approach this weeks exercises with a clear mind, knowing I won't understand everything I read, it took the pressure off me realising that, that's okay and it will come eventually. This is why I want to add more meditation in hopes that it becomes a daily habbit of mine.</p>

          <p class="values">Other human skills I want to improve on is mindfulness, empathy and self-awareness. I feel like this has improved a lot throughout foundations already but there's still more room for improvement. In my foundations reflection blog I touched on the roles that these play in learning and programming which are huge! Not only will they benefit my ability to learn and grow but help me help those around me which is the direction I want to be heading in terms of my goals and career as a programmer.</p>

        <h2 id="question">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>

          <p class="values">As long as I'm comfortable approaching them with whatever it is I'm struggling with and they have somewhat of a sense of humour then I'm happy!</p>

        <h2 id="question">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>

          <p class="values">From my knowledge of bootcamp and what is expected of us I think it's important that I establish a strong foundation of how I'll manage my workload aswel as my time with family. I'm fortunate enough to have all sorts of support from my family and partner that allows me to work productively because I know my kids are in good hands which takes a huge amount of pressure off me knowing that they are in good hands. Throughout this week I was able to sit down with my family and my partner and just let them know how busy I will be for the next 9 weeks and how they can help. It pretty much all comes down to having a strong support network and communication. I've also managed to find a routine that works for me that I've written out and have been following for the last 2 weeks and the most important parts of that routine is to make sure I'm getting at least 7 hours sleep every night, I'm taking breaks regularly, I'm drinking at least 3 litres of water everyday, I'm eating healthy food, I'm reaching out for help when I need it and that I remind myself of how far I've come and celebrating the small wins.</p>
