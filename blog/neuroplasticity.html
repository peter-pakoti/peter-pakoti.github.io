<h2 id="question">Research Neuroplasticity</h2>

  <p class="values">
    Neuroplasticity, or the capacity for our brain cells to change in response to our behavior, can help us more thoughtfully engage in activities that will contribute to our well-being no matter our age. This is important because we can influence our brain development in positive or negative directions. The more we engage and challenge our mind and body, the longer our brains function at a high level. There are also many other benefits to encouraging neuroplastic change.
  </p>
  <p class="values">
    Ways you could engage with the principels of neuroplasticity to benefit your life is to simply change your way of thought. It's deffinantly easier said than done if you have a fixed mind set and I use to have this fixed mindset in high school where I hated learning when in reality I just had no interest or passion for what I was learning. It made a huge difference in my life, I started to look for more things I may be interested in learning and just opens your mind to so many more opportunities.

<h2 id="question">Research Growth Mindset</h2>

  <p class="values">
    Growth mindset describes a way of viewing challenges and setbacks. People who have a growth mindset believe that even if they struggle with certain skills, their abilities aren't set in stone. They think that with work, their skills can improve over time.
  </p>
  <p class="values">
    Having a growth mindset is important because it can help you overcome obstacles you may face when learning something new or developing a new skill. Growth mindsets understand the importance of persistence and determination. By changing the way you think, you can change the way you learn.

  <p class="values">
    I feel like this exploration gave me a better understanding of a growth mindset and it's something that I find very important. It allows us to grow and gain more than we ever thought we could and not only that but once you start you gain this momentum and you want to just keep that ball rolling and explore other things that peak your interest.
  </p>
  <p class="values">
    A way that I'll integrate growth mindset into my learning journey is to just keep an open mind, keeping the idea in my head that there's many ways to do the same thing and being able to explore those ideas and find what works best for me.

<h2 id="question">Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h2>

  <p class="values">
    With these teachings it has given me a clearer understanding of what it is I want to incorporate in my own learning plan and that is to keep an open mind to different ways of doing something and figure out what works for me. It also puts into perspective how important self talk is and that's something I want to work on, I'd be lying if I said they weren't there but they are especially with how I'm feeling this sprint, I just want to be more aware of them and taking breaks when I do start hearing that negative self talk.
