<h2 id="question">A simple problem I was stuck on</h2>

  <p class="values">
    A simple problem I was stuck on was in the Javascript Kata exercise where I had to detemine whether a number was devisable by 3 or 5. I felt more confused on what the question was asking more than anything and struggled a lot with that throughout this exercise and it caused a lot of stress and confusion.
  </p>
  <p class="values">
    It wasn't until Joseph uploaded a video he had done explaining what it was asking and then what we needed to do. It was nice having someone to clear that up and give a bit more in depth understanding to what it is they were after, it made me feel more confident in working on the next few katas alone.
  </p>

  <div class="ptag-b">
    <img src="../Images/fizz.png" style="width:100%">
  </div>

  <p class="values">
    Joesphs helpful video taught me a lot, for example, if we take a look at the image on the left we can see that you don't NEED to use else or else if statements which is something I never knew. He also explained clearly how the modulo operator (%) is used and what it does, which gives back the remainder after interger division. One last thing that I learnt is that the order matters in your if else statements. If we refer to the image on the left, if I had writen that first if statement at the bottom it wouldn't work because it would either return 'Fizz' or 'Buzz' and once a function is done, that's it, it moves on. So by putting it at the top it will run that first and if that's not true then will continue till it returns true. (Hopefully that makes sense and you can understand what I'm trying to say...)
  </p>

<h2 id="question-pro">A problem I eligantly solved</h2>

  <p class="values">
    A problem I solved, I wouldn't say eligantly but with more confidence and backing my abilty was again in the Kata's exercise where you had to change the begining letter of a string to a capital and this is something that I learnt as I was going and was a small win for me!
  </p>
  <p class="values">
   Some problem solving techniques that I used constantly throughout this exercise was a lot of 
   <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjW3o-W9vz4AhWS-TgGHV0tCDcQPAgI"> Google </a>
   and alot of   
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enYdAxVcNZA"> Youtube </a>. 
   Sometimes I'd look for answers on google and not completely understand what I'm reading, then I'd take the same question and see if someone on youtube can explain what it is I'm after in a more understanding way. 
  </p>
  <p class="values">
    It deffinantly makes a massive difference when you understand the problem and understand what you're being asked of and for me this gave me a huge boost of confidence in myself and actually backed myself a bit with my abilty to code. It's not quite where I want to be in this journey but it's deffinantly a starting point and I'm looking forward to more growth!
  </p>
  <p class="values">
    Something I learnt through this process is having a bit more faith in my ability. A lot of the time I'd get stuck and confused and start talking down on myself, when in reality I'm more than capable of doing it, I just need to back myself more and when I am feeling lost, to reach out sooner! Don't be a hero and try work through it, reach out and get help!

<h2 id="question">Reflect</h2>

<h3 id="label">Pseudocode</h3>
  <p class="values">
    I've started to use pseudocoding a lot more now I know how and what to use it for, especially when things get a bit more complicated. I will be using a lot more throughout this journey and in the future for a more organised and understanding code. 
  </p>

<h3 id="label">Trying something</h3>
  <p class="values">
    I think this is what I used quite a lot in the past, trying/guessing. I don't personally prefer this method as it's not the most efficient however it does give me a better idea of where I am with Javascript in terms of what and how much I understand. 
  </p>

<h3 id="label">Rubber ducky method</h3>
  <p class="values">
   I haven't really used this method at all throughout my journey, however it's deffinantly something I'm open to doing especially if it helps my ability to explain the problem/s I'm having in a clear and understanding way.
  </p>

<h3 id="label">Reading error messages</h3>
  <p class="values">
    Reading the error messages has been a massive helping hand throughout this week and gives me a better understanding of what's not working and where in the code it is, which is helpful and saves a lot of time looking through trying to find where the issue is. 
  </p>

<h3 id="label">Console.logging</h3>
  <p class="values">
    This week has given me a much better understanding of console.logging and how important it is in order to understand what it is I'm actually putting in my code. It's again something I will be using more of in the future and throughout this course.
  </p>

<h3 id="label">Googling</h3>
  <p class="values">
    This is the method I'd say I probably use the most and has deffinantly been my kind of backbone throughout this week and will probably continue to be throughout my programming journey.
  </p>

<h3 id="label">Asking your peers for help</h3>
  <p class="values">
    This is a method that I want to use more of. It's not only that I'm able to gain from other people in this journey with me but allows me to meet people too. This has been something I've struggled with and it goes back to what I was saying earlier about reaching out sooner. 
  </p>

<h3 id="label">Asking coaches for help</h3>
  <p class="values">
    This also goes hand in hand with asking my peers for help. I need to reach out sooner and I've made a promise to myself that if I'm stuck on a problem for more than 2-3 hours to reach out and being honest with where and how I'm feeling.
  </p>

<h3 id="label">Improving your process with reflection</h3>
  <p class="values">
    This is something I want to improve on, especially at the rate of how fast pace things are, I want to take more notes of what I've learnt especially when I've solved a problem in order to gain better understanding of what I done and having the ability to refer back to it if the problem ever rises again.
