  <p> My name is Peter Pakoti and here's a little bit about myself! </p>

 <p>I was born and raised in the sunny Hawke's Bay and from a young age was always making something whether it was painting mum and dads walls, using buckets as a drum set to using dads old wood to make stilts, there was always something being made. Now here I am making my very own blog! </p>
 
 <p>
    Also don't be fooled by this photo because I'm a terrible snow boarder.</p>
 
    <p>
  I love music, art, fashion and all things creative. To me web development is just another expression of creativity! Oh and food, can't forget food.
 </p>
 
 <p>
  Coming into this course with zero coding background I'm pretty happy with the results of this website and how far I've come within a couple of weeks! Super stocked for the journey ahead!
 </p>
 
 <p> 
  Now I'm just adding this here cause I like the way it looks on the page. You really don't have to read this, there's nothing exciting going on here. If you made it this far, thank you. Give youself a pat on the back and do 5 star jumps.
